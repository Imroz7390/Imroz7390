Hey there! I’m Imroz Khan Mohammed — born and raised in Hyderabad, India, now pursuing my Master’s at Wright State University in Ohio.

🐍 Learning Python and loving every bit of it! The world of data engineering has caught my attention and I’m excited to dive in deeper.

🌱 Always curious, always growing. I love exploring new tech and finding smart solutions to fun (and tough) problems.

🤝 Whether it’s collaborating on projects or just sharing ideas, I enjoy connecting with people who love building cool things.
